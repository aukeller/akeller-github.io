The tool that I used to optimize the one on the right is called<a href="https://jpeg-optimizer.com/">JPEG Optimizer</a>. This tool compresses images to a lower quality, which is largely unnoticeable but helps reduce download time. Optimizing this picture resulted in a huge improvement. Based off the Developer Tools metrics, the one on the left took 36.89 milliseconds to download, while the one on the right took 21.6 milliseconds to download.</p></aside></main></body></html>
