    <h1>Final Analysis of Google Analytics Report</h1>
    <p>
      My <a href="./report.pdf" target="_blank">GA4 Analytics Report</a> gives a peek into how well my portfolio is doing,
      tracked by GA4 Analytics from January 2024 to May 2024. It shows
      important metrics like Views, Users, Views per User, and Average
      Engagement Time, letting me see how people use different pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      As indicated in the barchart in the upper right, the homepage (/index.html) was the busiest, getting lots of views. But
      the 'Contact' page (/contact.html) didn't gain as much traffic. It might
      need some work to get more people interested. I could try stuff like
      testing different versions of the 'Contact' page with A/B testing to see
      which has the most traffic, or using keywords that people search for more
      often to get more visitors. In the future, using Google SEO tricks could also
      help my website show up more in search results, as judging by the line graph there wasn't a ton of views after the first week I shared it.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using what I've learned and making changes, I hope to get more people
      interested in my portfolio website. My goal is to connect with more people in the
      field of front end web development, and this could help me do that.
